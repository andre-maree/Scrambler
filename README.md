# Scrambler

* Add an extra layer of protection of sensitive alphanumeric text or JSON data
* Pass entrypted data between browser and server, JavaScript to C#, and vice versa
* Encrypt alphanumeric text with a key, and de-obfuscate (reverse it) with the key
* There is a JavaScript version which can be used in a browser in the included file scrambler.htm
* Scrambled text is the same size as the original text, so it will not incur extra storage or transaction costs because of a larger size
* Scrambler is lightweight and fast

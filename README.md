# Scrambler

* Add an extra layer of protection of sensitive alpharumeric text data
* Pass scrambled text between browser and server, Javascipt to C#, and vice versa
* Obfuscate alphanumeric text based on a key, and de-obfuscate (reverse it) based on the key
* There is a Javascript version which can be used in a browser in the included file scrambler.htm
* Scrambled text is not larger in size than the input text, so it will not incur extra storage cost because of a larger size
* Scrabler is lightweight and fast

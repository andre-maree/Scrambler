# Scrambler

* Add an extra layer of protection of sensitive alpharumeric text data
* Obfuscate alphanumeric text based on a key, and de-obfuscate (reverse it) based on the key
* There is a Javascript version which can be used in a browser in the included file scrambler.htm
* Text can be obfuscated in Javascript and passed to C# and reverse the obfuscation, and vice versa
* Scrambled text is not larger in size than the input text, so it will not incur extra storage cost becuse of a larger size
* Scrabler is lightweight and fast
